# Interpretability of Machine Learning algorithms, through InterpretML.

This notebook is mainly based on the following paper [_"InterpretML: A Unified Framework for Machine Learning Interpretability" (H. Nori, S. Jenkins, P. Koch, and R. Caruana 2019)_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09223).

Some ressources about InterpretML:
- Paper [PDF link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.09223)
- GitHub [interpretml/interpret](https://github.com/interpretml/interpret)
- Website [interpret.ml](https://interpret.ml/)

This notebook was done by [Ludovic Sterlin](https://github.com/LudovicSterlin) as the evaluation part of Supervized and Deep Learning of [SDD-Algorithms in Machine Learning](https://supaerodatascience.github.io/syllabus.html).

It go through InterpretMl framework with basic and more concrete example datasets using InterpretML Dashboard and EBM methods.
